In this r script knitted file, the red wine quality data is investigated and analyzed. The red wive data contains 1599 observations of the different wine chemical and sugar properties and its corresponding rating. The aim of this project is to shed some light on the main properties that affect the wine quality and provide an insight into the different relationships between the wine contents and quality.
